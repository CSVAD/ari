## Bret Victor

Overall, I found his talk interesting because in order to make these technologies with the interfaces he is describing, one would need to make them using code. I really enjoyed the concept, but without code you will always be limited it seems by the predefined parameters and objects created within the system. I believe the tool he is demonstrating or future tools like this can be for people who do not need to learn how to code. They will be able to create these extremely dynamic objects or animations that before seem as if only programmers were able to do. Also, reading his article about working with the designers at Apple made me realize that these designers are never able to truly experience that sense of fulfillment when their design is implemented. Their design needs to be transformed and written in code by engineers, so that it can be finally placed into the product. Creating applications or tools like the one Ben Victor demonstrates can really give the designer that sense of completeness where they are able to see and have influence on their work all the way through.
