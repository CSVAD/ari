## Regularity from 10 PRINT

At first we look at the work and often pleased with the repetition , but usually it feels what further keeps us motivated and engaged with repetition art works are the ones where you are trying to discover variation in the repetition. I find this concept very interesting because it comes in all forms of art. A lot of times this could be a painting where at first glance the repetition is obvious, but as you look closer you can begin to notice it wasn’t exactly what you thought and it’s hard to tell how the artist added this variation. Another example could be in poetry, when a poet repeats lines multiple times within poem, but adds variation with the lines in-between to add more meaning. 

This also made me think of all the pattern recognition that goes into solving computer science problems. Being able to recognize these patterns and repetitions is often essential for optimizing the solution. Although this is not an artistic piece of art we are looking at to find these patterns. Within coding solutions you can see someone using their knowledge of patterns and repetition in the problem by seeing them use loops or possibly making recursive calls.
