## Final Proposal

My final project will be a library to create dynamic visualizations based off oscillators as the primative building block of this system. Users will be able to interact with this system through different types of parameters: 
		- low level parameters
			- amplitude
			- frequency
			- period
			- type of wave form
			- color
		- high level parameters
			- color
			- location
			- rotation
With these parameters the users will be able to create unique and dynamic visual outputs; in which the dynamic ouputs of the visualizations are built in to the primatives by way of the type of oscillations they create. This fosters an environment for exploring complex visuals built on the oscillator primatives.

In the same way as someone could create an algorithm to arrange pixels to form a square, processing provides basic 2D primatives such as rectangle to enable easy geometric visualizations. My library is also capable of being created through an algorithm, but the purpose of this library is to allow easy access to creating dynamic visuals comprising of oscillating primatives. 

This library will also be useful to those wanting to use these primatives as control signals for external applications. For instance, an extra bonus feature could include a simple mapping of the visual oscillator paramters created to generate audio oscillators.
