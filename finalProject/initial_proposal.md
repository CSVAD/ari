Create a programming library for Processing (or another programming language of your choice). The library must enable people to perform a set of operations in Processing that are currently not possible, or non-trivial with the standard Processing language. Alternatively, your library could enable people to work with Processing in a different way or through a different set of abstractions. It should not replicate the functionality of any existing user contributed libraries. Your library must include a set of at least 4 example projects, and a full documentation for all methods that are exposed to the user.

I would like to continue to create my oscillating visualization library and adapt it so that users can more easily send sound and create unique applications. I think it would also be interesting to create this structure within a 3D environment and learn how users would interact with that portion of the library. 

Create a series of generative works: Write an algorithm that creates a series of generative works (minimum 3, maximum 10). Document your process of designing the algorithim, including your initial goals and objectives, challenges, and criteria for selecting the final works in the series.

I would create some sort of generative work possibly using my oscillating visualization library above and also print/visualize these projects in a physical fasion. 

---------------------------------

Possible Collab work:

Design a physical/digital interaction between the processing interface and an object. This object could possibly be a person or maybe a simple machine. We would have a visualization and communication with the person/machine to create a feedback loop.
