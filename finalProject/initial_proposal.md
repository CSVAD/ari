Create a programming library for Processing (or another programming language of your choice). The library must enable people to perform a set of operations in Processing that are currently not possible, or non-trivial with the standard Processing language. Alternatively, your library could enable people to work with Processing in a different way or through a different set of abstractions. It should not replicate the functionality of any existing user contributed libraries. Your library must include a set of at least 4 example projects, and a full documentation for all methods that are exposed to the user.

I would like to continue to develop an audio/visual oscillator library and adapt it so that users can develop visual oscillators in Processing and generate corresponding sounds based on the frequency, amplitude, phase, etc.. I think it would also be interesting to create this structure within a 3D environment and learn how users would interact with that portion of the library.

 - Implementation challenges will be just continuing to learn the process and best practices when creating a library.

 - A design challenge will be how to make it more flexible, so that a user can tailor the experience towards their own designs--especially as it relates to representing oscillators in 3D.

 - I might evaluate the success by letting users try and use my library and see if they are able to make abstract things from the original example. It will be interesting to see how diverse the work created by users will be...if they are all very similar, perhaps more flexibility is needed. If they are all over the place, perhaps more constraints are needed to make the tools in the library more coherent. 

Create a series of generative works: Write an algorithm that creates a series of generative works (minimum 3, maximum 10). Document your process of designing the algorithim, including your initial goals and objectives, challenges, and criteria for selecting the final works in the series.

I would create some sort of generative work possibly using my visual oscillator library above and also print/visualize/laser cut these projects in a physical fashion.
- 	Implementation challenges will be experimenting with the plotter and learning what to expect when something is printed in a physical space from the digital space.
- 	Primary design challenges will be creating something unique enough that viewers will want to learn more and keep the viewer engaged with the work.
-	I will evaluate my success based on reactions from the viewers.

Possible Collab work:

Design a physical/digital interaction between the processing interface and an object. This object could possibly be a person or maybe a simple machine. We would have a visualization and communication with the person/machine to create a feedback loop.
