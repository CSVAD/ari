## Drawing Tool with DrawingManager Library

This tool is a combination of some of the examples within the DrawingManager library. I really enjoyed the pattern tool because it created an effect of changing the ellipse size depending how fast and the distance the mouse traveled. I also really liked the drip tool because of the similar effect it could give to someone painting and having there paint drip down on the canvas. Because this project was to create a drawing tool within processing though, I didn't want to make something that could also be done by hand. As Bret Victor discussed, drawing tools made on machines should be able to come alive, unlike regular drawing tools. When combining the drip and pattern effect, I increased the stroke on the drip as the size of the ellipse increased and vice versa. I also added a random gaussian to the drip effect, so that it would continuously move in random directions until it hit the end of the screen. When painting with a brush, one would not be able to recreate this same effect. I also added different parameters so that the user could change the amount of noise, color, and the direction of the drip (horizontal or vertical).
