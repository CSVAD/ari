This was my first time experimenting with a physical output and I really enjoyed the process of this. I personally had difficulty choosing the write drawing tool for the plotter and determining the height of the pen. I decided I did not want to use a ballpoint pen because I felt it would draw too similarily to the digital output. I went with a more flexible brush tip, so that their would be a more realistic output similar to someone physcially drawing these shapes. Determining the right height of the pen and making sure the paper was flat was an interesting experience too. At first there would be momemnts testing when the pen would draw streaks moving across the page because I was not lifting the pen high enough when drawing or the paper had some air underneath. I actually enjoyed the results of this because again it gave the output a more realistic feel revealing the human error when working with machines. Another interesting output the plotter added was drawing the first extremely small ellipses. I did not even notice them at first when looking at the processing digital output. Also, the plotter knew just to drop the pen to form a single dot for each instead of drawing an extremely small circle.
